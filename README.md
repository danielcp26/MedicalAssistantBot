This project implements a medical assistant chatbot powered by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. Built with Python and deployed on Azure ML Studio, the system integrates:


Data ingestion and preprocessing

Embedding generation with a vector database

Document retrieval pipeline

LLM-based response generation

Evaluation for accuracy and reliability


Tools and technologies include: Python, Azure ML Studio, OpenAI API, LangChain, and FAISS for vector search. The assistant is designed to answer medical-related queries with contextual accuracy, combining structured retrieval with generative AI.
